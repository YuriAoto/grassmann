Current git commit: 2aa059ca687f5285c7df78a9478091e3c6ffd720

Directory:
/home/yuriaoto/Documents/Codes/min_dist_Gr/tests/h2o_sym

Command:
../../dGr --loglevel 0 h2o_sym.out

From command line and environment:
External wave function, |extWF>: h2o_sym.out
Orbital basis of |extWF>: h2o_sym.out
Hartree-Fock orbitals, |min E>: h2o_sym.out
Using the optimiser based on the geometry of the Grassmannian. See:

Using |WFref> (the reference of |extWF>) as |min E>:
|<WFref|extWF>| =   0.95298382 ; D(WFref, extWF) =   0.30664696
Dimension of orbital space: alpha/beta: [ 7 2 4 0 ]
Number of alpha and beta electrons: 5 5
