CISD_FC.out 

From command line and environment:
External wave function, |extWF>: CISD_FC.out
Orbital basis of |extWF>: CISD_FC.out
Hartree-Fock orbitals, |min E>: CISD_FC.out
Using the optimiser based on the geometry of the Grassmannian. See:

Checking the two algorithms. No optimization will be performed.
Using |WFref> (the reference of |extWF>) as |min E>.
|<WFref|extWF>| =   0.95291635 ; D(WFref, extWF) =   0.30686691
Using the reference determinant (identity) as initial guess for U.
Dimension of orbital space: alpha/beta: [ 10 4 4 0 ]
Number of alpha and beta electrons: 3 3
Occupation of reference wave function: alpha/beta: [ 3 0 0 0 ]
allclose for f: True
allclose for C[0]: True
allclose for X[0,0]: True

Success! All comparisons are OK!!
Detailed information of comparison is written to the log file.
