CISD.out 

From command line and environment:
External wave function, |extWF>: CISD.out
Orbital basis of |extWF>: CISD.out
Hartree-Fock orbitals, |min E>: CISD.out
Using the optimiser based on the geometry of the Grassmannian. See:

Checking the two algorithms. No optimization will be performed.
Using |WFref> (the reference of |extWF>) as |min E>.
|<WFref|extWF>| =   0.75685327 ; D(WFref, extWF) =   0.69734744
Using the reference determinant (identity) as initial guess for U.
Dimension of orbital space: alpha/beta: [ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ]
Number of alpha and beta electrons: 1 1
Occupation of reference wave function: alpha/beta: [ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]
allclose for f: True
allclose for C[0]: True
allclose for X[0,0]: True

Success! All comparisons are OK!!
Detailed information of comparison is written to the log file.
