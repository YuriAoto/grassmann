* Improvements

** Memory

*** TODO at wave_functions.fci, call the function _set_memory() before

    The way it is, with _set_memory() being called after storing all determinants
    we are using the memory before declaring it. This is not appropriate.
    However, to change this behaviour we need to calculate the number of determinants
    before, what is not trivial.

*** TODO at memory.py, save all chunks

    We can save all allocated chuncks, so that this can be nicely printed
    or logged if one wants to see where memory is being used.


** TODO Make better code for generate_orb.py




*** Integrals

**** TODO Add interface cpp/Python to IR-WMME

**** TODO Improve basis set library

** TODO Better DIIS for Hartree-Fock
